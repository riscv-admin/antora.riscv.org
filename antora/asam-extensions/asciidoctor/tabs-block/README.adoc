== How
Extends the AsciiDoc syntax to support a tabset element. The tabset is
created from a dlist that is enclosed in an example block marked with the
tabs style.

Usage:

To use this extension, register the extension.js file with Antora (i.e.,
list it as an AsciiDoc extension in the Antora playbook file), combine
styles.css with the styles for the site, and combine behavior.js with the
JavaScript loaded by the page.
