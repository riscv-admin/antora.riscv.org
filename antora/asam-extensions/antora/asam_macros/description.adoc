= ASAM Macros

IMPORTANT: ASAM macros are not supported in partials as they are replaced through Antora rather than Asciidoctor, but partials are included by Asciidoctor at a later stage.

== Configuration
This extension does not require any configuration.


== The "related" macro
Creates a subsection called "Related Topics" and filles it automatically with cross-references to (other) pages containing the listed keywords.
Works similar to the macro `reference`, but adds said subsection.

== The "reference" macro
Creates an automatically generated list with cross-references to (other) pages containing the listed keywords.
Works similar to the macro `related` but does not add a subsection.

For more, see https://asam-ev.github.io/asam-project-guide/asamprojectguide/project-guide/macros/macro-reference.html[ASAM Project Guide^]

== The "pages" macro
Creates an automatically generated list under a new section "Pages" with cross-references to (other) pages in the defined folder.
If no folder is defined, the file's folder is used instead.

In addition to this replacement, an attribute `:pagemacro:` is automatically set so that the section numbering feature will exclude this section title automatically.

== The "role_related" macro
Creates an automatically generated list under a new section "Role-related topics" with cross-references to (other) pages containing the relevant role.

For more, see https://asam-ev.github.io/asam-project-guide/asamprojectguide/project-guide/macros/macro-role_related.html[ASAM Project Guide^]

== The "autonav" macro
If added as a comment line to a nav.adoc file, replaces the files content with an automatically generated pages summary containing all pages and folders in the module.
The path structure is preserved.
