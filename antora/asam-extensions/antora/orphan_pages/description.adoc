= Orphan pages and partials
The ASAM Antora extension finds all pages not listed in any nav.adoc and puts a warning in the console output.
If configured, these pages can also automatically be listed under a separated navigation entry (e.g. "orphans") at the end of the Antora document.
Additionally, it optionally lists all partials that are not included in at least one hosted page.
Finally, it optionally lists all pages and partials that currently use a "draft" section.

For more, see https://asam-ev.github.io/asam-project-guide/asamprojectguide/project-guide/extensions/pipeline-orphan_pages.html[ASAM Project Guide^]

== Configuration
The orphan_pages extension is always active.
To activate the optional features "listing unused partials" and "listing files with draft sections", add the following configuration to the extension attributes::
[source, YAML]
----
list_unused_partials: true
----

To add the found orphan pages to the navigation, add the following configuration to the extension attributes:
[source, YAML]
----
add_to_navigation: true
----

By default, the standard name under which orphan pages are then added, is 'Unlisted pages'.
To give it a different name, add the following configuration to the extension attributes:

[source, YAML]
----
unlisted_pages_heading: "Orphan pages"
----

.Configuration for adding orphan pages under the label "Lost and found" and listing all unused partials and content with draft flags.
====
[source,YAML]
----
antora:
  extensions:
  - require: './asam-antora-extensions/asam-antora_extension.js'
    add_to_navigation: true
    unlisted_pages_heading: "Lost and found"
    list_unused_partials: true

== How it works
This is an extension based on an example provided by the Antora project.
The example is documented in full https://docs.antora.org/antora/latest/extend/extension-tutorial/[here^].
The source code can be found in the https://gitlab.com/antora/antora/-/blob/main/docs/modules/extend/examples/unlisted-pages-extension.js[Antora repository^]

The custom ASAM changes include:

* Listing unused partials
* Listing files with the draft tag
* Parsing specific plantuml content (for osc2)

Here, the extension checks all relevant files for the include macro.
Then, all included partials are deducted from the total list of partials and the remaining ones are listed by the logger.
Additionally, all partials and all pages (both published and unpublished) are scanned for the entry "ifdef::draft[]".
If this is found, the file is marked as a file including draft content and listed by the logger afterwards as well.
